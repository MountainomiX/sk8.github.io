          <h3>Wheel Creation</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="wheelD">
          <p>
            Polyurethane skateboard wheels were invented in the early 1970s and were a big change from the old metel or ceramic wheels, as they had a better grip on surfaces, were more durable amd greatly imporved shock absorbtion. 
            Skateboard wheels come in a range of diffrent sizes, colours, and graphic designs for the rider there are many practical and asthetic considerations.

        <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col">
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        The making of wheels begins on a computer, where a designer uses CAD tools to guide the cutting tools, which creates the aluminum mold. The mold can either be a one part of two part mold.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Next the fresh polyurethane mixture is poured into the wheel molds through a nosel. The polyurethane mixture starts to solidify immediatly.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The moldes are then loaded into an oven and baked at almost 240 degrees Fahrenheit (115 degrees celsius) for 40 miuntes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        During baking any bubbles in the polyurethane rise to the top and are defused leaving solid forms with no weak spots.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A worker then blasts compressed air between the wheels and the molds to pry the wheels free and pop them out.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A sample wheel is then choesn and probed with a durometer gauge to insure the urethane has cured to the right degree of hardness
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the sample wheel is sufficiently hard a worker clamps each skateboard wheel in a lathe, the lathe spins the wheel while an automatic cutter contours the edges to a softer more rounded profile.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Graphic designs are selected and arranged on a computer, a film is then printed of the chosen images, a worker will use the negitive to produce a printing plate from a piece of metal thats been coated with a light sensitive substance known as emulsion.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The film negitive is placed in the plate inside a UV light chamber, this triggers a photochemical reaction that reansfers the image from the negitive to the plate.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A soloution is then applied that removes unexposed emulsion and in the proccess etches the imige into the printing plate.
                       
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The plate is then rinsed to remove the chemicals, then dried to reveal the etched artwork.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A magnetized ink cup is positioned over the image and it is installed into a pad printing machine.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The ink cup deposits ink onto the printing plate and a silicon pad picks up the inked image and stamps it onto the skateboard wheel.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The wheels are then loaded into a testing device which will gauge the rebound. A metal ball is dropped onto the wheel and mesures how high it bounces or rebounds. A high rebound is desiarable.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The wheels are now cleared for shipping, and are packaged up and sent out from the factory.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
