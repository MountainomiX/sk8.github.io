            <p>
                The process of making a skateboard begins with the deck. Most skateboard decks are made of glue and wood (usually maple), but some are made of composites, aluminum, nylon, Plexiglas, fiberglass, foam, and other artificial materials.
                Modern decks vary in size, but most are 7 to 10.5 inches (18 to 27 cm) wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between 28 and 33 inches (71 and 84 cm) long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.

            <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="col">
                            <ol>
                                    <li> 
                                        The maple wood undergoes a treatment that allows it to be peeled into veneers (thin sheets of wood) that are then delivered to the deck factory. They are stored in a climate-controlled environment to ensure the moisture content is optimized. Too much moisture is not good for the manufacturing process.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Each veneer is then put into a glue machine by hand. This machine evenly coats each veneer with a water-based glue specially designed for wood.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        After being coated, the veneers are numbered and stacked according to grain and level of use. Each skateboard is made of seven layers of veneer. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and seventh layers have the grain running from the nose to the tail of the board. The third and fifth have the grain running from side to side.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        These stacks are put into a two-part mold inside a hydraulic press. The mold creates the nose, concave, and tail of each skateboard. Each press makes 5 to 15 decks at one time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Once left in the mold for a few hours the stacks are removed, using a drilling rig 8 holes (4 at the nose and tail) are drilled into the skateboard.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The skateboard is then shaped by hand using a band saw then sanded and coated with sealer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Once the deck is dry the final step is to decorate. Screenpriting is used to apply a decorative design to the top and bottom of the deck.
                                    </li>
