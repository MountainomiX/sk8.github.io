                    Hardware is a term used by the skatebaord community to describe a range of items that are used when building a skateboard. These items involve Trucks, Bearings and Mounting Hardware.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The first and main component to hardware are the trucks. These are the two metal t-shaped trucks seen underneath the skateboard, the purpose of the skateboard truck is to support the deck and the second role is to steer the board.
                        The truck is made up of two components. The baseplate which is a plate of metal (usually aluminim) attached to the deck. The axel which pivots on two two urethane cushions (called bushings) and a pivot point.This construction enables the wheels (which are attached to the axles) to swing in a predefined arc, which allows the skateboard to turn.
                        Skateboard trucks come in a variaty of shpaes and sizes to match skateboard size, style and prefrence.

                        Bearings

                    <p>
                        Skateboard bearings are round metal pieces that fit inside the skateboard wheels to mount the wheels to the axel, and allow the wheel to spin freely.
                        Most bearings are the same size and fit most skateboard wheels. Most bearings are mesuared by an ABEC rating ranging from ABEC 1 all the way up to ABEC 9+, with 1 being the slowest and lowest quality. Although there are a handful of companys that do not follow the ABEC rating system.
                        A bearing is comprimised of 7 small parts. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> C-ring: a thin ring that fits into a groove on the outside of the bearing to lock the shields in place.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bearing Shield: a medium-sized ring on the side of the bearing that prevents dirt from getting into the ball bearings.</li>
                        <li>
                            Outer ring: the round metal exterior that all of the other parts fit into.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Inner Ring: the smaller metal ring that fits within the outer ring. When you slide your bearing/wheel setup onto the axles, the inner ring is what the axles fit through.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Steel balls: set of 6 or 7 steel or ceramic balls that rest in the ball retainer. These are arguably the most important part of the bearing, as they allow the bearing casing to spin around them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ball Retainer: also called a Delrin crown, the ball retainer holds the individual ball bearings in place, while still allowing the casing to spin around them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rubber seal: The soft rubber ring on the outside of the bearing that assists in shielding the bearing interior against dirt and debris.

                        Hardware is the common term used for the set of bolts and locknuts used to connect the truck to the deck. Each truck requires four botls and locknuts to skrew it onto the deck. 
                        The skrews can come in either a Allen or Phillips head and in a range of colours.
